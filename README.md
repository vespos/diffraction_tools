Diffractometer calculation:
  Calculates diffraction angles for 2+2 circles and 4 circles geometries. 
  Run the corresponding GUI script to access the interface.
  Reverse calculation are only available for the 2+2 geometry at the moment.
  2+2C convention:
    horizontal sample surface:
      gamma: righthanded
      delta: righthanded
      omega: righthanded
      alpha: righthanded
    vertical sample surface:
      gamma: righthanded
      delta: lefthanded
      omega: lefthanded
      alpha: righthanded
